They are housed in the Asia Library at the University of Michigan. The slides are in Japanese and include drawings, colored cartoons, and images of the scales of justice with citizens. They were part of the effort to popularize the constitution. The slides were a gift from Alfred Hussey, an attorney and American officer during World War II.",

These papers form an important picture of the formation and early activity of the Michigan Anti-Slavery Society, with a record of their official resolutions, activities and expenditures. They provide insight into the inner workings of one of the most important state-level Garrisonian antislavery societies.

         "description":"The Harry Alverson Franck Photographs document the travels of Franck and his wife, Rachel Latta Franck, mostly in China and South America. Harry A. Franck (1881-1962) was a University of Michigan graduate (1903), avid traveler, and veteran of both world wars. The black and white images in this collection were digitally photographed from original negatives on nitrate or acetate film and reversed into positives, while the color images are from hand-colored lantern slides (on glass) that Frank had prepared to illustrate his lectures. Most of the color images therefore have a black and white counterpart in the negative series.",

Schumacher was an early jazz enthusiast and featured on the show jazz recordings dating from 1917 to 1947. Each episode included six or seven recordings along with brief commentary from Schumacher.

The Islamic Art Archives is comprised of four series, and the Simpson material thus comprises the fifth series, which now spans a century of scholarship on Islamic art, painting, architecture, and archaeology.",

Bonner published Studies in Magical Amulets, Chiefly Graeco-Egyptian, a monograph containing a catalog of 398 magical amulets, including those amulets from Bonner’s collection. Mostly from Egypt and Syria, and produced from the 1st century B.C.E. to the 4th century C.E., these amulets can be defined as ancient precious stones engraved with symbolic iconography and wording, designed to protect their owners against the uncertainties of life, particularly in the spheres of health, love, and prosperity."

Watkins collaborated with preeminent performers and producers, recording successes and failures as well as his encounters with celebrities such as P. T. Barnum, Junius Brutus Booth, Edwin Forrest, Anna Cora Mowatt, and Lucy Stone. His is the only known diary of substantial length and scope written by a U.S. actor before the Civil War - making Watkins, essentially, the antebellum equivalent of Samuel Pepys.",

Founded on the belief that people made good decisions if armed with good information, the paper attempted to provide a voice to the views of ordinary citizens in a city where African Americans were the majority. The paper was often considered by some to be controversial, insisting on holding elected officials accountable for their actions and providing sole coverage of grassroots groups and movements.",

The survey questionnaires asked for biographical, occupational and leadership position information. In their deeply personal reflections and memories, the responses are a vital record of the lived experiences of women at one of the premier institutions of the United States in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.",

More than 95,000 specimens that have an image associated with the record are included here. Some records contain complete collection, preparation, and taxonomic detail, while others only have a specimen data image and limited taxonomic detail. Records include specimen information from the early 1800s through the present and are of global distribution. Most of our databased or digitized records currently are of Orthoptera (grasshoppers, katydids, and crickets), Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies), and Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants).",

Approximately 251,000 cataloged lots including over 406 holotype specimens and more than 1638 paratype lots are preserved as dry shells, ethanol preserved specimens, frozen tissues, lyophilized tissues, fossil material and radular microscope slide mounts. Mollusks from all regions of the planet are represented, most from North America, particularly from southeastern and upper mid‐western USA drainages. With the exception of Monoplacophora and Aplacophora, all extant molluscan classes are represented.",
